With a heavy heart, I have to announce that **Your Daily Tool** is being discontinued.

## 🌟 The Story of Your Daily Tool

Your Daily Tool was my first major project, marking the beginning of my journey into programming. My goal was to create a platform that simplifies daily tasks – featuring a calculator, conversion tools, a calendar, and even a vocabulary trainer.

It was a passion project, born out of my curiosity for software development and my love for technology. I dedicated a lot of time and effort to improving and expanding it.

## ❌ Why Is It Shutting Down?

Unfortunately, I have to discontinue the project due to financial reasons. Running and maintaining a platform not only takes time but also money – for servers, domains, and further development. Without sufficient resources, it is no longer sustainable to keep Your Daily Tool running at the quality I envisioned.

## 💬 Thank You to All Users!

I want to sincerely thank everyone who used and supported Your Daily Tool. This project has taught me a lot and was an important milestone in my journey as a developer. Even though it’s ending now, I won’t stop programming – this was just the beginning!

Maybe one day, Your Daily Tool will return in a new form. Until then, thank you for your support! 🚀
